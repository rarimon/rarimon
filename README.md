Hi, I’m a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** with expertise in the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)**. Over the years, I have developed a range of **scalable web applications** and **RESTful APIs** that solve real-world problems and provide excellent user experiences.

I have a strong focus on **JavaScript** technologies, and I enjoy working with both the **frontend** and **backend** of web applications. My goal is to create optimized, scalable, and maintainable applications with a keen attention to detail and performance.

I’m constantly learning new technologies and improving my existing skills. Whether it’s building complex applications from scratch or improving an existing project, I’m always ready for new challenges.

Feel free to check out some of my projects and let’s connect!
