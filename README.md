**About Me**

Hi, Iâ€™m a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** with expertise in the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)**. Over the years, I have developed a range of **scalable web applications** and **RESTful APIs** that solve real-world problems and provide excellent user experiences.

I have a strong focus on **JavaScript** technologies, and I enjoy working with both the **frontend** and **backend** of web applications. My goal is to create optimized, scalable, and maintainable applications with a keen attention to detail and performance.

Iâ€™m constantly learning new technologies and improving my existing skills. Whether itâ€™s building complex applications from scratch or improving an existing project, Iâ€™m always ready for new challenges.
